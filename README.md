# MakerJumpToSelectionPlugin

Adds a button to the various maker panels to jump the selection scroll windows to the position of the selected item. It's the little down triangle next to the X close button. Most windows have it to the left of the X, but some windows have that spot taken so it's just under instead.

...That's it. Not complicated.
